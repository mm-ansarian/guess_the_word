## Introduction
"Guess the Word" is an entertaining and simple game about the English words.
If you like, you can run it in terminal(the terminal version of this game is available right now). Or you can play this game in its own special GUI!

## How to Play
In this game, a word is selected. You don't know what is the selected word and you should find the selected word by guessing each letter of the word.
For example for the word "Play", "_ _ _ _" will be shown to you and you have a limit of turns to guess the letters; if you guess the "p" and "a" letters, the shown 
word will transform to "P _ a _". If you could guess all the letters or whole the word successfully(before finishing your turns), you win; otherwise
you lose.
You will discover the other things and the different methods after playing the game for several times. ðŸ˜Š
